# The questions machine

An experiment from Populate to run you trough a deck of quick questions and make you think about it.

We are starting with a first deck about corruption and how all of us, sometimes, do small actions
that can be considered corruption.

## Contribute

This is an open project. We'd love to hear from you, to receive new questions or to collaborate in
the codebase.

## About the development

We use mainly Vue.js and Ruby on Rails.

To install the project

1. clone the repository
2. `cd questions`
3. `rails db:setup` 
4. Open the browser in `http://localhost:3000`
